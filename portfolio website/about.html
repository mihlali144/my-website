    <p>Mihlali Nkomo is a young girl who was born and bread in Johannesburg but later moved to the Eastern Cape(mdantsane) at the age of 14. life went on and I passed my metric and went to college for a totally different caurse to what we are doing now. Now years later I saw a post and I took the chances and I applied and thankfully i was accepted so it meant I had to move again to Cape town for this opportunity meaning I have been staying in Cape Town for only a month. And now I am an intern at Younglings for web development.<br>
